# SecondBite

## saviors of food & waste

### About

This app is made to help solving two problems in one step: give away food you don't need and at the same time avoid waste.

### Heroku deployment

https://second-bite.herokuapp.com/

*(Because of an error after deploying on Heroku, the Create-screen remains white. There is a conflict between the react-hook-forms and the Antd-Timepickers that is not visible in the local development. This issue will be resolved soon.)*
